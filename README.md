## üîê Using `netplwiz` in Windows ‚Äî User Account Control Utility

### üìå What is `netplwiz`?

`netplwiz` is a built-in Windows utility that provides a graphical interface to manage **user accounts** on a local machine. It's a shortcut to the **"User Accounts"** control panel.

### üß≠ How to Open It

1. Press `Win + R` to open the **Run** dialog.
2. Type `netplwiz` and press `Enter`.

This opens the **User Accounts** window.

### üîç What Can You Do With It?

Once the `netplwiz` utility is open, you can:

* View all **local user accounts**
* Add or remove **users**
* Change a user's **group membership** (e.g., Administrator, Standard User)
* Reset passwords for local users
* **Enable or disable automatic login**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automatic Login (Security Note)

One commonly used feature in `netplwiz` is the ability to disable the password prompt during login:

* Uncheck the box labeled **"Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer."**
* When you click **Apply**, you will be prompted to enter the username and password.
* After that, Windows will automatically log in with that account.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Risk**: Enabling automatic login bypasses password protection at startup, which can be a risk on shared or portable devices.
